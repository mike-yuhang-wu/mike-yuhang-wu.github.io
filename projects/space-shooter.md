Have you ever wonder how will a game developed with C++ by someone who knows nothing about pointers, objects, etc? This is a game like that!

This is a game where you control a jet in a space background and shoot down whatever appear in front of you.

I developed this game while following a game development tutorial. What was amazing was I added features that was not in the tutorial, such as animation of the jet the player control. Unfortunately, I did not finish this game as the school starts. Below is a video showing me testing this game.
