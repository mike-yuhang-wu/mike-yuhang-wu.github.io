Tag is a game that I developed in 5 hours with help from AI. The idea of this game came from tag game that I played with my classmates in elementary school. I have to admit, this text-based tag game is a little boring compared to playing tag with friends in a grassfield.

Here is a copy of the console during a game play:

--------------------------------------------------

You are about to play tag with your computer in an 25 by 25 meters map. You get to move toward one direction out of left, right, forward, backward you wish. Your goal is to "tag" your target, which also moves around each round, by ending at the same location on the map as them.

W - GO UPWARD
S - GO DOWNWARD
A - GO LEFTWARD
D - GO RIGHTWARD

Enter Y to play, any other key to quit: Y
